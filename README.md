# Numerical verifications

Implement numerically some algorithms to confirm intuition
on problems of combinatorics, discrete probabilities, various brainteasers
that have struck up my curiosity.

The repository has a flat structure where each subfolder is either 
it's own exercise or a group of exercises,
and markdown files each make up for one exercise.
The exercises split up as follows :

**Numerical implementations :**

1. [Counting positive paths](positive_path_count/README.md)
2. [Optimising some discrete order execution](discrete_optimal_execution/README.md)
3. [Random walk crossing threshold probability](negative_price_probability/README.md)
4. [Counting diagonal paths](counting_diagonal_paths/README.md)

**Formal proofs :**

5. [Dealing cards evenly without observation](dealing_indistinguishable_cards/README.md)
6. [How to simulate a pair of standard Gaussian variables from a 2d uniform variable](gaussian_from_uniform_samples.md)

**Programming competitions :**

6. [IEEEXtreme 19 Challenge](ieeextreme19/README.md)

*Topics include :*
- combinatorics, probabilities, pseudo-random number generation, optimisation,
- benchmarking small Rust programmes, using adapted data structures.
