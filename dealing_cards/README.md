## Dealing indistinguishable cards 

With a deck of 52 cards 
and the initial information that it comprises 17 cards facing up and 35 facing down,
find an algorithm so to dealing the deck in two piles,
such that the two piles have the same number of cards facing upwards.
The only allowed operation is to flip an arbitrary amount of cards.
Cards are not visible before or at any time during the algorithm.

**Solution**

<p style="color:green">
Take 17 of those cards, flip all of them. 
This forms one pile and the other cards - untouched - go in the other pile.
