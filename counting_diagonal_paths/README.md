## Counting diagonal paths

Starting at $(0,0)$, 
how many paths are there to reach $(4,6)$,
going either UP or RIGHT at each turn,
and avoiding to go three times in the same directlion successively ?

<p style="color:green">
The total number of paths, without the constraint is :

$$\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$$

The objective is then to count the number of paths that are not valid,
that is paths containing 
one or more sequence of three successive UP or RIGHT.
